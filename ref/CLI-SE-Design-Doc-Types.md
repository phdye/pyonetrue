## CLI - Fundamental Software Engineering Design Documents

---

### 1. **Architecture Overview Document**

This document defines the high-level design of the software system—its major components, how they interact, and the rationale behind those choices. It does not delve into low-level implementation details but instead paints a top-down picture of the CLI tool’s structure. It includes elements like process flow (e.g., command parsing to action dispatch), data flow (e.g., input/output transformation), component responsibilities (e.g., `CommandRouter`, `ConfigLoader`, `OutputFormatter`), and possibly diagrams like flowcharts or component interaction diagrams. If the tool is meant to grow modularly (e.g., plugin support or subcommand registration), this document should clearly define the interfaces and separation of concerns.

A well-formed architecture document is distinct from other documents in that it avoids API specifics (that’s for specs or interface docs) and avoids testing or deployment configuration (those belong to test or ops docs). To validate whether a document is properly architectural in nature, look for content that addresses **structure and intention of code layout and responsibility boundaries**, such as, “The command handler delegates execution to isolated modules which communicate via a message-passing protocol for future IPC extensibility.”

### 2. **Command Specification and Interface Design**

This document details the user-facing command-line interface (CLI): what commands are available, what arguments they take, what flags modify their behavior, and what input/output behavior users can expect. It should define every CLI command, subcommand, option, and example usage. This is the canonical source for the contract between the tool and its users. It often includes argument formats, default behaviors, shorthand options, and expected output formats (e.g., JSON vs human-readable output). For tools that are expected to be used in scripts or automation, this document should also define exit codes and output stability expectations.

Unlike the architecture document, this one is purely **interface-focused**—it doesn't describe how functionality is implemented, but only what the user sees and how they can interact with the system. To determine if a document is properly a command specification, verify that it could be used independently to build a mock CLI wrapper or write user documentation. It must answer questions like: “What happens when I run `tool sync --dry-run`?”, not “How is the sync feature implemented?”

### 3. **Test Plan and Verification Strategy**

This document outlines how the system is tested, what needs to be tested, and what the success criteria are. It defines test coverage expectations, testing tiers (unit, integration, end-to-end), mock usage policies, and verification constraints (e.g., deterministic output, tolerance for flaky tests). It should also specify what should be tested for each command (e.g., input validation, failure modes, output correctness, edge cases) and whether testing includes command-line parsing, shell integration, or regression tests.

This document is distinct because it **establishes the criteria for correctness and safety**, rather than describing behavior or structure. If a document focuses on when and how tests are written, what types of tests are mandatory, or what automated test frameworks are used (e.g., `pytest`, `tox`, `bats` for bash), it is a verification strategy. To confirm a document falls under this category, check whether it directly informs how and when tests are written, how bugs are reproduced and verified, and how code is accepted as working.
