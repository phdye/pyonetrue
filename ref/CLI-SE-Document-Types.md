### 1. **README Document**

The `README.md` serves as the public face and primary entry point for understanding the software. It should be comprehensive but concise enough that someone new to the project can grasp the purpose, usage, and setup within minutes. A properly constructed README should include the following elements:

* **Project Overview**: A short description of what the project does, its purpose, and its value proposition.
* **Installation Instructions**: Step-by-step commands to install dependencies, preferably using a package manager.
* **Usage Examples**: Sample CLI invocations (`./mytool --option value`) with expected outputs, helping users verify correct installation.
* **Development Instructions**: If applicable, include how to run the app in development mode, test locally, and rebuild it.
* **Links and References**: Point to additional docs, issue tracker, or contribution guidelines.

You can distinguish a README from other docs by its **introductory and integrative nature**—it doesn’t go deep into architecture or design, but it connects users and contributors to everything else they need to know. It’s the *what and how* of using the software, not the *why* or *how it works internally*.

### 2. **Architecture & Design Document (ARCHITECTURE.md or DESIGN.md)**

This document dives into the **internal structure and reasoning behind design decisions**. While not always written in formal diagrammatic styles like C4 or UML (though they help), this document should explain the technical structure, including:

* **Component Overview**: What are the core modules? For a CLI, perhaps an input parser, command dispatcher, and output formatter.
* **Flow Diagrams**: Illustrate how data flows through commands or how configuration is loaded and applied.
* **Design Decisions**: Include rationale for key choices—why you chose a specific argument parser library or why output is in JSON.
* **Extensibility Plan**: Indicate how others can add new commands, flags, or integrations in a way that doesn’t break the current structure.

Unlike the README, this doc is **developer-facing** and assumes technical familiarity. It's meant to help someone dive into the codebase and understand *why* things are built a certain way, and *how* they interact internally. If someone can rebuild or significantly alter the CLI tool after reading it, it’s done its job.

### 3. **CLI Specification Document**

Often overlooked in small projects, a **CLI Specification Document** acts like an interface contract. It should fully define the external behavior of the CLI, including:

* **Command Hierarchy**: Document each command (`init`, `deploy`, `status`) and subcommand structure.
* **Options and Flags**: Describe every flag (`--verbose`, `--output json`) and its behavior, including default values and constraints.
* **Exit Codes**: Clearly list exit codes and what conditions trigger them.
* **Input/Output Format**: Specify how inputs are validated and what format outputs follow—stdout, stderr usage, JSON vs plain text, etc.
* **Error Handling**: Detail expected error messages, including examples and how to interpret them.

This document is **distinct from a user guide** in that it's more formal and exhaustive. It may serve as the basis for automated testing or integration with tools like `argparse`, `click`, or shell completion scripts. A good spec allows someone to implement the same CLI behavior in another language or context, demonstrating its precision and completeness.

### 4. **CONTRIBUTING.md**

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` document provides a **clear, opinionated guide for collaborators**, whether internal teammates or open-source contributors. It sets expectations around how to engage with the project and ensures consistent development workflows. A well-crafted CONTRIBUTING file typically includes:

* **Development Setup Instructions**: Beyond what’s in the README, this section might explain how to clone the repo, set up a virtual environment, or run a local development version of the CLI.
* **Code Standards**: Outline expected styles (e.g., Python with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/); JavaScript with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)), naming conventions, or folder structures.
* **Commit Guidelines**: Recommend or enforce commit message formats (e.g., [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)) for clarity and changelog generation.
* **Issue and PR Templates**: Describe how to submit bug reports or feature requests, what labels to use, and how to open a pull request with appropriate review expectations.
* **Testing and CI Expectations**: Explain how to run tests locally and how the CI pipeline works.

The key distinction here is that CONTRIBUTING.md is **procedural and community-oriented**—it governs *how* people should work with the project, rather than *what* the project does (README) or *how* it's built (architecture). If someone asks, “Can I help?”—this is the document you hand them.

### 5. **Test Strategy Document**

A `TESTING.md` (or test strategy section within CONTRIBUTING if you want to be concise) provides a structured overview of **how correctness is verified** in the project. Even a small CLI benefits from clear guidelines here, which might include:

* **Types of Tests**:

  * *Unit Tests*: Functions and methods like input validation, config loaders, etc.
  * *Integration Tests*: Full command runs with arguments, validating end-to-end behavior.
  * *Regression Tests*: Historical bugs with dedicated cases to prevent recurrence.
* **Testing Framework**: Specify the tooling used (`pytest`, `unittest`, `Jest`, etc.), including dependencies, test runners, and coverage tracking.
* **Execution Guide**: How to run all tests (`make test`, `npm test`, `tox`, etc.) and how to test a single component.
* **Test Organization**: Directory structure, naming conventions, and where test fixtures are stored.
* **CI Integration**: Describe how tests are run in continuous integration—what gates must pass before code is merged.

Unlike a simple listing of test files, a test strategy is **a policy-level artifact**. It explains the "what", "why", and "how" of testing, offering confidence to contributors and helping ensure that the project behaves as expected across changes. If a new contributor can write tests without asking questions after reading it, it’s fulfilling its purpose.

### 6. **CHANGELOG.md**

The `CHANGELOG.md` records a **structured, chronological history of changes** to the software. While Git commits show what changed, a changelog explains changes in a human-readable, curated format. Key elements of a good changelog include:

* **Version Headings**: Clearly marked version tags (e.g., `## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-01`), possibly following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
* **Change Categories**: Group updates under consistent categories like:

  * `Added` – new features
  * `Changed` – updates to existing functionality
  * `Deprecated` – soon-to-be removed features
  * `Removed` – deletions
  * `Fixed` – bug fixes
  * `Security` – vulnerabilities addressed
* **Linking**: Optionally link to GitHub issues, pull requests, or commits for traceability.
* **Automation Support**: If using tools like `standard-version`, `release-it`, or `auto-changelog`, explain the workflow briefly.

The changelog is different from Git history or release notes in that it’s **a maintained, user-facing digest** of meaningful updates. It answers the question, “What changed between version X and Y, and do I need to care?” A properly maintained CHANGELOG.md enables safe upgrades and fosters trust in the software’s evolution.
