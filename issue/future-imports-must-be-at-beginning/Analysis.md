Here is a detailed analysis of how the `__future__` import placement error occurred, based on `ISSUE.txt`.

## üìÇ Root Cause Breakdown from `ISSUE.txt`

### Command Execution Trace

The commands issued were:

```bash
cd ~/src/wrapped/cygport
PYTHONPATH=. pyonetrue --output flat/cygport.py cygport
python3 flat/cygport.py
```

This pipeline does the following:

* Navigates into the source tree for the `cygport` wrapper.
* Runs `pyonetrue` to flatten the `cygport` package into a single output file: `flat/cygport.py`.
* Attempts to run the resulting script via `python3`.

### Observed Failure

The error:

```
  File "/c/-/self/src/wrapped/cygport/flat/cygport.py", line 7
    from __future__ import print_function
    ^
SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file
```

### Interpretation

This tells us:

* `pyonetrue` correctly **preserved the future import**, but incorrectly **positioned it on line 7**.
* Lines 1‚Äì6 likely contained:

  * A docstring or file-level comment(s)
  * Regular imports (e.g., `import os`, `import subprocess`)
  * Possibly blank lines or other future-unrelated content

According to Python‚Äôs syntax rules (PEP 236):

> ‚ÄúFuture statements must appear near the top of the module. The only lines that can appear before a future statement are the module docstring and comments.‚Äù

## üõ†Ô∏è Implication for `pyonetrue`

This is a **structure-level violation** introduced during the flattening process. The `pyonetrue` tool must explicitly:

1. **Parse out `__future__` imports separately.**
2. **Insert them immediately after any module docstring**.
3. **Ensure nothing else precedes them**, not even other `import` or `from ... import ...` statements.

Failing to follow this leads to **hard runtime errors**, which cannot be caught until execution time, making it a critical class of bug.

---

## üß© Suggested Diagnostic Improvements

The fact that the issue only surfaced at runtime suggests `pyonetrue` lacks:

* **Structural conformance checks** post-flattening.
* **Test cases** for Python syntax rules like `__future__`.

Both should be added.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* The error occurred because `pyonetrue` placed a `from __future__ import print_function` statement **after other content**, violating Python's requirement that future imports appear at the very top (after docstring only).
* This was confirmed by running the generated `flat/cygport.py`, which failed at line 7.
* The flattening process must enforce correct ordering of `__future__` imports during code generation.
* `ISSUE.txt` confirms this behavior unambiguously and provides a minimal setup to reproduce it.

Would you like me to patch `pyonetrue` to fix this behavior and include a regression test to prevent reoccurrence?
