# Final Recommendation

The CI failure stemmed from platform-dependent module discovery and symbol ordering. To ensure flattened packages are deterministic and correct, implement the following steps:

1. **Deterministic discovery** – Always iterate over `sorted(path.rglob('*.py'))` when gathering modules so local and CI builds see the same file order.
2. **Dependency-aware ordering** – Parse each module's imports, build a dependency graph, and topologically sort modules so referenced symbols appear after their definitions.
3. **Optional user control** – Provide a CLI flag for a custom module order or to preserve per-module grouping without interleaving.
4. **Post-build validation** – After flattening, run `py_compile` or try importing the result to fail fast if any symbol is used before being defined.
5. **Improved tests** – Add tests that flatten packages with cross-module references to confirm deterministic output and correct ordering across platforms.

These measures together address nondeterministic discovery and early symbol usage, producing reliable, portable builds.
