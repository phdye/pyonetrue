Usage:
  pyonetrue [options] <input>
  pyonetrue (-h | --help)
  pyonetrue --version

Flatten Python package files into a well ordered, single module.

<input> can be a python package name, a directory or a file:
  package    The <package-root> via PYTHONPATH becomes the directory.
  directory  All Python files under the directory will be flattened.
  file       It will be ordered, fixes a poor ordering.

In all cases, the module is written to the specified output file or stdout.

A main guard is a block of code that is only executed when the module
is run as a script. It is typically used to test the module or to
provide a command-line interface. The main guard is usually
written as:

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # code to execute when the module is run as a script
        pass

<package>/__main__.py is a special module that is executed when the
package is run as a script.  It is typically used to provide a command-line
interface to the package.  If such a module is present, it will be included
at the end of without reordering unless the --no-cli option is used.  Other
__main__.py modules are not included by default.  If you want to include
one of them instead, you can use the --main-from option to specify the
sub-package from which to include __main__.py.

Default behavior is to :
* All relative imports are eliminated. Flattened output is fully self-contained.
* Main guards are discarded, but this can be changed with the --main-all
  or --main-from options.
* Write the output to stdout, but this can be changed with the --output
* Name clashes, duplicate top-level names, are not allowed by default.

Options:
  --output <file>      Write output to file (default: stdout).
  --no-cli             Do not include package's __main__.py.
  --main-from <mod>    Include __main__.py from the specified sub-package.
                       Only one __main__.py module is allowed.
                       Overrides --no-cli.
  --all-guards         Include all __main__ guards. (default: discard)
  --guards-from <mod>  Include __main__ guards only from <mod>.
  --exclude <exclude>  Exclude specified packages or modules, comma separated.
  --include <include>  Exclude specified packages or modules, comma separated.
  --ignore-clashes     Allow duplicate top-level names without error.
  -h, --help           Show this help message.
  --version            Show version.
